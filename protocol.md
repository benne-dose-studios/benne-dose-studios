# 📜 benne-dose-studios – Role Protocol  

This protocol defines the roles in our ecosystem and their **Do’s & Don’ts**.  
Roles are fluid — you can pick up multiple or switch over time — but clarity of action keeps us aligned.  

---

## 🎮 Indie Developer  
**Do**  
- Prototype quickly and share openly.  
- Write clean, modular code others can remix.  
- Mentor beginners in setting up indie pipelines.  
- Prioritize projects that reflect Bengaluru/Karnataka stories.  

**Don’t**  
- Hoard code in private forks.  
- Over-engineer at the cost of playfulness.  
- Ignore cultural/aesthetic context of projects.  

---

## 🧪 Computational Researcher  
**Do**  
- Publish experiments, datasets, and failures openly.  
- Document findings in accessible ways (notebooks, READMEs).  
- Explore collaborations with design, history, and linguistics.  
- Push the frontier of AI/algorithms while keeping it community-facing.  

**Don’t**  
- Lock research in academic/corporate silos.  
- Overcomplicate without explaining.  
- Chase only benchmarks instead of curiosity.  

---

## 🎨 Designer & Aesthetic Lead  
**Do**  
- Create shared asset libraries (colors, fonts, sprites).  
- Make every project visually coherent and culturally rooted.  
- Teach design literacy to developers.  
- Champion beauty, delight, and clarity in all outputs.  

**Don’t**  
- Treat design as an afterthought.  
- Copy-paste global templates without local relevance.  
- Ignore accessibility (fonts, contrast, usability).  

---

## 🏙 DAO Builder  
**Do**  
- Prototype DAOs for Bengaluru neighborhoods.  
- Share governance models openly for others to adapt.  
- Prioritize civic and cultural benefit over speculation.  
- Treat DAOs as experiments in community building.  

**Don’t**  
- Build closed or token-gated systems.  
- Use DAOs only as financial gimmicks.  
- Ignore learnings from failed experiments.  

---

## 🗣 Kannada Computationalist  
**Do**  
- Build NLP tools, datasets, and protocols for Kannada.  
- Localize projects with Kannada interfaces/fonts.  
- Document resources so they can be reused widely.  
- Partner with cultural and educational institutions.  

**Don’t**  
- Default to English-only design.  
- Gatekeep Kannada resources.  
- Prioritize profit over open cultural preservation.

## 🌐 Community Weaver  
**Do**  
- Welcome and onboard new contributors warmly.  
- Facilitate discussions, resolve conflicts openly.  
- Organize jams, hacknights, and cultural sessions.  
- Keep the spirit of the manifesto alive.  

**Don’t**  
- Create hierarchies of “senior” vs “junior.”  
- Allow toxicity or exclusion.  
- Centralize power in a single group.  

---

## 📢 Storyteller / Archivist  
**Do**  
- Write devlogs, zines, and blogs about projects.  
- Archive code, art, and stories (successes & failures).  
- Connect work to Bengaluru/Karnataka narratives.  
- Spread projects beyond GitHub to wider communities.  

**Don’t**  
- Let experiments disappear undocumented.  
- Oversell — stay true to the project’s actual impact.  
- Forget the cultural context behind projects.  

---

## 🌟 Closing  
These protocols ensure each role supports our shared vision: **open, local, cultural, and infinite.**  
Roles are not rigid jobs — they are hats you can wear.  
Follow the Do’s, avoid the Don’ts, and together we create the benne-dose way.
