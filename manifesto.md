# ðŸš€ benne-dose-studios â€“ Manifesto  

We are dreamers, coders, designers, researchers, and storytellers from Bengaluru.  
We believe technology is not just code â€” it is culture.  
It carries the flavor of the people who build it, just like benne dose carries the taste of home.

## âœŠ What We Stand For  
- **Open-Source Freedom** â†’ Everything we make is for everyone, forever.  
- **Indie Courage** â†’ To create outside corporations, to play, to fail, to try again.  
- **Bengaluruâ€™s Spirit** â†’ A city of chaos, creativity, and endless invention.  
- **Design & Beauty** â†’ Code should delight the eye and the soul.  
- **Roots & Future** â†’ Kannada, Karnataka, and Bharatiya heritage carried into new computational worlds.  
- **Community & Commons** â†’ Technology must strengthen people, not isolate them.

## ðŸ§­ Why We Build â€“ Societal Problems & Our Response  

| Societal Problem | Our Response |
|------------------|--------------|
| **Tech is corporate-dominated** â†’ most Bengaluru talent is locked in outsourcing & big companies. | Build indie pipelines and mentor coders to create outside corporate silos. |
| **Design & aesthetics undervalued** â†’ projects often lack beauty, storytelling, and local identity. | Train contributors in design; use Karnataka culture as a shared design language. |
| **Kannada marginalized in tech** â†’ poor NLP tools, lack of datasets, weak computational support. | Create Kannada protocols, datasets, and open computational tools. |
| **Fragmented civic communities** â†’ neighborhoods lack tech-enabled self-organization. | Prototype DAOs for each Bengaluru area as civic experiments. |
| **Innovation is top-down** â†’ research locked in academia/corporates, little public R&D. | Encourage open, curiosity-driven R&D and publish experiments freely. |
| **Cultural memory fading** â†’ history, stories, and philosophies underrepresented in digital media. | Make games, tools, and art that encode Karnatakaâ€™s history & spirit. |

## ðŸŒ± Roles in the Ecosystem  

Every contributor shapes the ecosystem by taking up roles. Roles are fluid, open, and collaborative:  

- **Indie Developer** â†’ Builds small-to-mid scale projects; mentors others in indie pipelines.  
- **Computational Researcher** â†’ Runs experiments, publishes datasets, opens new technical possibilities.  
- **Designer & Aesthetic Lead** â†’ Crafts visual language, ensures cultural and aesthetic resonance.  
- **DAO Builder** â†’ Prototypes decentralized governance for Bengaluruâ€™s neighborhoods.  
- **Kannada Computationalist** â†’ Develops tools, protocols, and datasets for Kannadaâ€™s digital future.  
- **Community Weaver** â†’ Onboards contributors, facilitates collaboration, holds the ethos together.  
- **Storyteller / Archivist** â†’ Captures narratives, documents history, and spreads the word.  

Together, these roles form a creative society â€” not just a studio.

## ðŸŒ± Our Promise  
Every project we create is:  
- **Accessible** â†’ anyone can use it, learn from it, remix it.  
- **Cultural** â†’ carrying a piece of Bengaluru, Karnataka, or Bharatiya imagination.  
- **Experimental** â†’ weâ€™d rather try boldly than play safe.  
- **Collaborative** â†’ no hierarchies, just shared protocols and respect.

## ðŸ¥˜ The Benne Dose Way  
Like the benne dose:  
- **Simple at first glance**  
- **Rich with layers when tasted**  
- **Beloved by the community**  

This is how we build.

If youâ€™re from Bengaluru, or if you love its energy â€” **join us.**  
Write code. Draw sprites. Make music. Share ideas.  
Together, letâ€™s turn curiosity into creation, and creation into culture.  

**We are benne-dose-studios.  
We are open. We are local. We are infinite.**
