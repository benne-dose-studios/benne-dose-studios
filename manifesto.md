# 🚀 benne-dose-studios – Manifesto  

We are dreamers, coders, designers, and storytellers from Bengaluru.  
We believe technology is not just code — it is culture.  
It carries the flavor of the people who build it, just like benne dose carries the taste of home.

## ✊ What We Stand For  
- We stand for **open-source freedom** — everything we make is for everyone, forever.  
- We stand for **indie courage** — to create outside corporations, to play, to fail, to try again.  
- We stand for **Bengaluru’s spirit** — a city of chaos, creativity, and endless invention.  
- We stand for **design and beauty** — code should delight the eye and the soul.  
- We stand for **roots and future** — Kannada, Karnataka, and Bharatiya heritage carried into new computational worlds.  
- We stand for **community and commons** — technology must strengthen people, not isolate them.

## 🌱 Our Promise  
Every project we create is:  
- **Accessible** → anyone can use it, learn from it, remix it.  
- **Cultural** → carrying a piece of Bengaluru, Karnataka, or Bharatiya imagination.  
- **Experimental** → we’d rather try boldly than play safe.  
- **Collaborative** → no hierarchies, just shared protocols and respect.  

---

## 🌏 Why We Exist  
Because Bengaluru deserves more than being a corporate outsourcing hub.  
Because techies deserve the joy of indie creation.  
Because Kannada deserves its rightful place in the computational future.  
Because beauty, play, and open collaboration can spark something viral — and maybe even change the city.

## 🥘 The Benne Dose Way  
Like the benne dose:  
- **Simple at first glance**  
- **Rich with layers when tasted**  
- **Beloved by the community**  

This is how we build.

## 🌟 Call to Action  
If you’re from Bengaluru, or if you love its energy — **join us.**  
Write code. Draw sprites. Make music. Share ideas.  
Together, let’s turn curiosity into creation, and creation into culture.  

**We are benne-dose-studios.  
We are open. We are local. We are infinite.**
