## ðŸ§­ Why We Build â€“ Societal Problems & Our Response  

Bengaluru and Karnataka face unique challenges at the intersection of culture, technology, and community.  
benne-dose-studios exists to experiment with open-source solutions to these.  

| Societal Problem | Our Response (via Projects) |
|------------------|-----------------------------|
| **Tech is corporate-dominated** â†’ most Bengaluru talent is locked in outsourcing & big companies. | Build indie pipelines, mentor coders to create outside corporate silos. |
| **Design & aesthetics undervalued** â†’ projects often lack beauty, storytelling, and local identity. | Train contributors in design; use Karnataka culture as a design language. |
| **Kannada marginalized in tech** â†’ poor NLP tools, lack of open datasets, weak computational support. | Create Kannada protocols, datasets, and open-source computational tools. |
| **Fragmented civic communities** â†’ neighborhoods lack tech-enabled self-organization. | Prototype DAOs for each Bengaluru area as civic experiments. |
| **Innovation is top-down** â†’ research locked in academia/corporates, little public R&D. | Encourage open, curiosity-driven R&D and publish experiments freely. |
| **Cultural memory fading** â†’ history, stories, and local philosophies underrepresented in digital media. | Make games, tools, and art that encode Karnatakaâ€™s history & spirit. |
