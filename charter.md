# 🍛 benne-dose-studios – Charter  

We are a collective of friends and collaborators experimenting with fun, open-source projects.  
Our inspiration comes from Bengaluru, Karnataka, and the larger Bharatiya cultural imagination.  
This charter defines our purpose, values, and goals so all contributors can align on a shared vision.

## 🎯 Purpose  
To nurture a playful yet serious open-source ecosystem from Bengaluru, where technology, design, and culture merge to create tools, games, and protocols rooted in Bharatiya and Kannada spirit.

## 🏛 Organizational Values  
1. **Open Collaboration** – All work is transparent, remixable, and shared freely.  
2. **Local Roots, Global Standards** – We draw from Bengaluru & Karnataka culture, while maintaining world-class technical quality.  
3. **Indie Spirit** – Empower individuals to create, explore, and innovate without needing large institutions.  
4. **Organic R&D** – Encourage bottom-up computational research led by curiosity, not hierarchy.  
5. **Aesthetic Excellence** – Value beauty, design, and storytelling as much as technical depth.  
6. **Civic Future** – Use tech as a tool to strengthen Bengaluru’s cultural and civic life, not just for profit.

## 🌱 Goals  
1. **Indie Development Capacity**  
   - Build a pipeline for Bengaluru techies to practice small-to-mid scale indie projects.  
   - Share resources, mentorship, and collaborative coding habits.  

2. **Organic Computational R&D**  
   - Create platforms, meetups, and projects that let the public experiment with AI, algorithms, and new tools.  
   - Encourage curiosity-driven exploration outside of corporate silos.  

3. **Design & Aesthetics**  
   - Train contributors to value visual storytelling and cultural symbolism.  
   - Build strong graphic and UI/UX practices tied to local motifs and history.  

4. **Bengaluru DAOs**  
   - Prototype decentralized communities for key city areas (e.g., Basavanagudi DAO, Whitefield DAO).  
   - Use them as experiments in civic tech, governance, and community building.  

5. **Kannada Computational Protocols**  
   - Develop open protocols, datasets, and tools for Kannada-based NLP, search, and cultural computing.  
   - Establish Bengaluru as a hub for computational humanities research.

## 🌟 Closing Note  
**benne-dose-studios** is not just about projects.  
It is about building a commons where code, culture, and community can thrive together — Bengaluru-style.
